Many people celebrate the new year. It symbolises a fresh start, new beginnings. A time for reflections and renewed promises. A hope for changes for the better.

But why not a new month, a new week or a new day?

I think a year is a good amount of time. Not too short to not be able to achieve anything meaningful; not too long such that things that happened along the way are forgotten during retrospection.

But we don’t have to wait for the planet to make a full orbit around the sun to start on something.

Every day is a new day, and an opportunity to start afresh, to reflect, to dream, to make plans, to set goals, and to take action.

New Year’s Day is a day like any other, and any day can be equally as meaningful if we make it so.

Happy new year. Happy new day.
